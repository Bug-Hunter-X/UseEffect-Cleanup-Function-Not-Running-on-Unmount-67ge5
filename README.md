# React useEffect Cleanup Function Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue with React's `useEffect` hook where the cleanup function doesn't always run as expected, specifically when a component unmounts before the cleanup function has a chance to execute. This can lead to memory leaks or other unexpected behavior.

## Problem

The `useEffect` hook in the `bug.js` file includes a cleanup function that should execute when the component unmounts. However, under certain circumstances (such as fast rerenders or rapid component switching), this cleanup function might not run, leading to potential problems.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution.  While the underlying issue might be related to the timing of when the component is unmounted,  the solution improves the scenario.  It is important to note that there's no guaranteed way to always run the cleanup function if the component is unmounted extremely rapidly.  The solution focuses on making the cleanup more robust.
